Instructions on how to feed my cats when I am away.

## Location of Cat Food

The open can of cat food will be in the fridge.  The unopened cans are in the floor cupboard door immediately to the right of the fridge.  This is also where Rory's kibble is.  Midnight's kibble is immediately next to her dish.

## Location of medications.

The medications are on the counter, immediately to the left of the sink.

## Rory

This cat inhabits the main area of the apartment, is a complete pig, and lives to consume food.  Just fill his food bowls, located at the far end of the apartment at the base of the windows, in between Deena's desk and the couch.  He'll deplete them at his own pace.

His water dishes are located next to the main bathroom.  Rory is a disgusting drinker, and uses his filthy, filthy paw to drink, which means his water will be gross when you get there.  Please empty and rinse his bowls before refilling.

There is more than one of each bowl, so please fill all, especially if you are going to be absent for a few days.

Rory gets a quarter-can of wet food each day, unadulturated.  The bowls for this food will be on the counter, next to the medicine.

## Midnight

Midnight fights with Rory (or Rory fights with Midnight, we don't know which) and thus is kept separate from him in the main bedroom.  Please take care when entering that she does not escape, nor Rory enter, lest A Fight ensue.

She may not be visible when you enter, as she can be skittish.  Or she may be desperate for affection.  Who can know in advance?  She is a cat, and her whims are subject to no human scrutiny.

Her food bowl is immediately in front of the door.  It will likely still be mostly full when you arrive, but if you feel like attempting to gain her (incredibly fickle) affection, you can add more food to the bowl and then supplicate before her.

Her water bowl should be visible on entering the room, at the far side of the room, beneath the window.  It should be emptied in the bathroom sink and refilled.

Midnight gets a quarter-can of wet food each day, but it must be made up Special.

First, add the wet food, then open the Dasuquin bottle to the left of the sink and grab a single capsule.  Twist it open, pour the enclosed powder into the wet food, and mash it up.

Next, take a quarter pill from the purple container, and tuck it somewhere in the middle of the mashed-up food.  She won't find it, but she will eat it.

**NOTE:** Midnight is sometimes disgusting and may have barfed somewhere (including on the bed) or gotten poop stuck to her and scooted it across something to get it off (including on the bed).  If this happens and you're uncomfortable dealing with it, just... Just let me know, and I'll clean it up when I get back.  In the meantime, she made her bed (literally and figuratively) and can lay in it (literally and figuratively).

## Yog-soggoth

The hallway closet is the domain of Yog-soggoth and he is fed not from the container, but your very soul.  Thankfully, he only requires a couple every millenium, and was fed as recently as the 1600s.  He can be left to his own devices, and as I have recently installed an automatic laser pointer machine (as it turns out, also good for distracting pesky ancient gods), so he shouldn't need entertainment either.

For all our safety, when you leave for a few days, please replace the battery in the automatic laser pointer machine.  If it runs out while you're away, there will be no gods powerful enough to rescue us from our eternal torment.

## Emergencies

The cats' vet is Mt. Pleasant - Davisville Animal Hospital, which is located at 745 Mount Pleasant Rd (416-481-7387). Their normal hours are Mon-Fri 8:00-5:00, Saturday and Sunday: closed.

Holiday hours:

December 24: 7:30am-1pm
December 25: CLOSED
December 26: CLOSED

The cat carriers are in the top of the coat closet, next to the office door.

Always please try to get in touch with me if something comes up, but prioritize getting the cat in question into care first.  Feel free to take an Uber/Lyft/Cab and pass the receipt along to me later.  If you can't get in touch with me and the problem requires less than $2000 to address (or they want to order tests up to that amount), **go ahead**.  They should know the cats there and be okay with us paying it on return, but if not and you are comfortable, I'll gladly pay you back ASAP.

Midnight is on an insurance plan, so that might even cover some of the costs.
