Instructions on how to feed my cats when I am away.

## Location of Cat Food

The open cans of cat food will be in the fridge, in the door, in the butter compartment.  The unopened cans are in the floor cupboard door immediately to the right of the fridge.  This is also where Rory's kibble is.  Midnight's kibble is immediately next to her dish.

## Location of medications.

The medications are on the counter, immediately to the right of the fridge, above the cupboard door containing the unopened cans of food.

## Rory

This cat inhabits the main area of the apartment, is a complete pig, and lives to consume food.  Just fill his food bowls, located at the far end of the apartment at the base of the windows, in between Deena's desk and the couch.  He'll deplete them at his own pace.

His water dishes are located next to the main bathroom.  Rory is a disgusting drinker, and uses his filthy, filthy paw to drink, which means his water will be gross when you get there.  Please empty and rinse his bowls before refilling.

There is more than one of each bowl, so please fill all, especially if you are going to be absent for a few days.

Rory gets an eight of the large can of wet food twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening).  In the morning, you can just give him the wet food plain, but in the evening, please mix one packet of probiotic (small white & blue box containing like 60 packets, located with the medicine) in and mash it around.  He may not eat any of this food.  That is normal.  Use any of the small plates in the upper cupboard to the right of the stove for this wet food.

## Midnight

Midnight fights with Rory (or Rory fights with Midnight, we don't know which) and thus is kept separate from him in the main bedroom.  Please take care when entering the bedroom that she does not escape, nor Rory enter, lest A Fight ensue.

She may not be visible when you enter, as she can be skittish.  Or she may be desperate for affection.  Who can know in advance?  She is a cat, and her whims are subject to no human scrutiny.

Her food bowl is across the room, in front of the window.  It will likely still be mostly full when you arrive, but if you feel like attempting to gain her (incredibly fickle) affection, you can add more food to the bowl and then supplicate before her.

Her water bowl should be visible on entering the room, directly in front of the door.  It should be emptied in the bathroom sink and refilled.

Midnight gets one third of the small can of cat food twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening).  In the morning, you can just give her the wet food plain, but in the evening, please mix one packet of probiotic (see Rory's information for details), a third of a quarter-teaspoon (effectively, yes, a twelfth-teaspoon) of laxative (small container of white powder located with the medicine), and some Dasuquin every second day.

The Dasuquin is actually easier to keep track of than you might expect - check the pink pill container with the medicine.  If there is a green capsule in there, she gets Dasuquin that day.  If not, she doesn't!  Open the capsule and add it to the other powders you have piled high upon her food, and mash it all together.  She thinks it tastes great and will consume it all, but maybe not all immediately, is all.  (She may just have gorged on kibble, or she may just be picky.)

**NOTE:** Midnight is sometimes disgusting and may have barfed somewhere (including on the bed) or gotten poop stuck to her and scooted it across something to get it off (including on the bed).  If this happens and you're uncomfortable dealing with it, just... Just let me know, and I'll clean it up when I get back.  In the meantime, she made her bed (literally and figuratively) and can lay in it (literally and figuratively).

## The plants

There's a whole bunch of plants both out on the balcony _and in the office!_  Please keep an eye on them, and if they start to look wilty, give them a thorough soaking.

If any peppers drop off, please either a) go ahead and eat it! or b) toss it in the crisper drawer in the fridge and I'll do something with it when I get back.

## Emergencies

The cats' vet is Mt. Pleasant - Davisville Animal Hospital, which is located at 745 Mount Pleasant Rd (416-481-7387). Their normal hours are Mon-Fri 8:00-5:00, Saturday and Sunday: closed.

Holiday hours:

December 24: 7:30am-1pm
December 25: CLOSED
December 26: CLOSED

The cat carriers are in the top of the coat closet, next to the office door.  Alternatively, there is a cat backpack in the bedroom, on the side of the bed nearest the bathroom.  It's much, much easier to transport a cat in there, but depending on the nature of the emergency, that may not be possible.

Always please try to get in touch with me if something comes up, but prioritize getting the cat in question into care if I can't be reached.  Feel free to take an Uber/Lyft/Cab and pass the receipt along to me later.  If you can't get in touch with me and the problem requires less than $2000 to address (or they want to order tests up to that amount), **go ahead**.  They should know the cats there and be okay with us paying it on return, but if not and you are comfortable, I'll gladly pay you back ASAP.

Midnight is on an insurance plan, so that might even cover some of the costs.
