Instructions on how to feed my cats when I am away.

## Location of Cat Food

While facing the sink, open the floor cupboard furthest to the left.  This is where all the cat food and such lives.

## Rory and Lancelot

These two cats inhabit the main area of the apartment, and are complete pigs and live to consume food.  They graze on dry food, which is in the plastic container in the cupboard, but they have a very specific ritual with regards to wet food.

Twice a day (breakfast and dinner), you'll need to get out little glass bowls for them which are located in the lower cupboard just to the *right* of the sink.  If there are none, please wash some.  They don't always eat all their food, so you can't just refill the bowls - they get gross.

Rory gets a half-can of the C/D chicken stew, with a bit of water, mixed up.  He's picky.  Lancelot gets a quarter-can of the K/D chicken stew, mixed with a quarter-teaspoon of the powder on the counter.  He's not picky, but he needs that medicine to make poopin' easier.

Put down Lancelot's food in front of him, then distract Rory with his bowl and lead him into the computer room.  He'll follow.  Shut him in there while Lancelot eats.

When Lancelot has finished his first quarter of food, it's time to give him some *more* medicine!  There is a small brown bottle of painkiller in the food cupboard, and a syringe on the counter.  Draw 0.15 mL of the medicine into the syringe and squirt it into his mouth.  He'll fight you a bit because it's not a pleasant feeling, but it tastes like chicken, so he'll forgive you pretty quickly.

After he's gotten his shot in the mouth, give him another quarter-can of K/D chicken stew.  Both cats should have eaten a half-can by now.  Once Lancelot is done eating his food (or well, once he gives up on eating it), you can let Rory out.  We try to make sure Lancelot eats as much of his own food as possible, since he'll try to steal Rory's, and his own food is specially good for his kidneys, which aren't the greatest.

Their water dish is located across the room from their food bowls, at the base of the tall black lamp.  It is a fountain bowl, and needs to be refilled so it doesn't run dry.  Just fill a cup with water (cups can be found above the sink) and top it up.  There is also a bowl of water near the end of the table.  Please rinse and refill this at mealtimes, because hey, why not have more water?

When you leave for a few days, please put down an extra bowl of food and water.

## Midnight

Midnight fights with Rory (or Rory fights with Midnight, we don't know which yet) and thus is kept separate from him in the main bedroom.  She may not be visible when you enter, as she can be skittish.  Or she may be desperate for affection.  Who can know in advance?  She is a cat, and her whims are subject to no human scrutiny.

Her food bowl should be visible on entering the room, immediately opposite the door.  Midnight is a grazer, and thus her bowl can and will be filled before I leave.  As a consequence, it will likely still be mostly full when you arrive, but if you feel like attempting to gain her (incredibly fickle) affection, you can add more food to the bowl and then supplicate before her.  She is fed from the plastic container as well.

She also receives some wet food at mealtimes, though she is not typically picky of what kind.  We're using up all the pate-style food we have lying around currently, but if you cannot find any, you can use a can of Rory's C/D.  She gets either a half-can of a small can, or a quarter-can of a big can per meal.

Lastly, her water bowl is on the far side of the bed, also at the base of a lamp.  It should be emptied in the bathroom sink and refilled.

Again, when you leave for a few days, please put down an extra bowl of food and water.  If you need more bowls, there are plenty in the lower cabinet to the right of the sink.

## Yog-soggoth

The hallway closet is the domain of Yog-soggoth and he is fed not from the container, but your very soul.  Thankfully, he only requires a couple every millenium, and was fed as recently as the 1600s.  He can be left to his own devices, and as I have recently installed an automatic laser pointer machine (as it turns out, also good for distracting pesky ancient gods), he shouldn't need entertainment either.

For all our safety, when you leave for a few days, please replace the battery in the automatic laser pointer machine.  If it runs out while you're away, there will be no gods powerful enough to rescue us from our eternal torment.
