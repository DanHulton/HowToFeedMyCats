Instructions on how to feed my cats when I am away.

## Location of Cat Food

While facing the sink, open the floor cupboard furthest to the left.  This is where all the cat food and such lives.

## Rory

This cat inhabits the main area of the apartment, is a complete pig, and lives to consume food.  Just fill his food bowls, located at the opposite end of the kitchen at the base of the windows.  He'll deplete them at his own pace.

His water dishes are located next to his food bowls.  Rory is a disgusting drinker, and uses his filthy, filthy paw to drink, which means his water will be gross when you get in.  Please empty and rinse his bowls before refilling.

There is more than one of each bowl, so please fill all, especially if you are going to leave for a few days.

## Midnight

Midnight fights with Rory (or Rory fights with Midnight, we don't know which) and thus is kept separate from him in the main bedroom.  This is the door at the far end of the hall.  Please take care when entering that she does not escape, nor Rory enter, lest A Fight ensue.

She may not be visible when you enter, as she can be skittish.  Or she may be desperate for affection.  Who can know in advance?  She is a cat, and her whims are subject to no human scrutiny.

Her food bowl is on the far side of the bed, at the base of a lamp.  It will likely still be mostly full when you arrive, but if you feel like attempting to gain her (incredibly fickle) affection, you can add more food to the bowl and then supplicate before her.  She is fed from the plastic container located just next to the door.

Her water bowl should be visible on entering the room, immediately opposite the door.  It should be emptied in the bathroom sink and refilled.

Midnight recieves a single pill daily, and must be tricked into taking it.  Her pills are in the entertainment unit at the foot of the bed, in the glassed-in container.  Take a Pill Pocket, rip it in half, and place a pill in one half.  Then, give her either the pocket with or without the pill - you get to choose!  The point is that she never knows which pocket has the pill and which is tasty all the way through.  We hope to keep her guessing, and keep her eating the pill, forever.

She also gets a lil' bit of pumpkin with some Dasuquin mixed in.  There is a tiny jar of orange glob in the fridge - this is the pumpkin.  Dump about a tablespoon on a plate, open a capsule of Dasuquin, and mix it fully.  Rory will at this point be convinced that you have set up wet food for him and will be freaking out.  He can be distracted by a handful of thrown treats (located in the same cupboard as the food) while you deliver the plate to Midnight.

## Yog-soggoth

The hallway closet is the domain of Yog-soggoth and he is fed not from the container, but your very soul.  Thankfully, he only requires a couple every millenium, and was fed as recently as the 1600s.  He can be left to his own devices, and as I have recently installed an automatic laser pointer machine (as it turns out, also good for distracting pesky ancient gods), he shouldn't need entertainment either.

For all our safety, when you leave for a few days, please replace the battery in the automatic laser pointer machine.  If it runs out while you're away, there will be no gods powerful enough to rescue us from our eternal torment.
