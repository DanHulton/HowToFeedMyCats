Instructions on how to feed my cats when I am away.

## Location of Cat Food

While facing the sink, open the floor cupboard furthest to the left.  This is where all the cat food and such lives.

## Rory and Lancelot

These two cats inhabit the main area of the apartment, and are complete pigs and thus the reason I need someone to feed my cats.  I cannot simply leave enough for them to eat over the two days - they will demolish it all in a night and then go hungry the remaining two days.

They are fed from the Hill's Prescription Diet c/d bag.  Shake about a half-cup into each bowl, located on the floor next to the television.

Their water dish is located across the room from their food bowls, at the base of the tall black lamp.  It is a fountain bowl, and needs to be refilled so it doesn't run dry.  Just fill a cup with water (cups can be found above the sink) and top it up.

## Midnight

Midnight fights with Rory (or Rory fights with Midnight, we don't know which yet) and thus is kept separate from him in the main bedroom.  She may not be visible when you enter, as she can be skittish.  Or she may be desperate for affection.  Who can know in advance?  She is a cat, and her whims are subject to no human scrutiny.

Her food bowl should be visible on entering the room, immediately opposite the door.  Midnight is a grazer, and thus her bowl can and will be filled before I leave.  As a consequence, it will likely still be mostly full when you arrive, but if you feel like attempting to gain her (incredibly fickle) affection, you can add more food to the bowl and then supplicate before her.  She is fed from the plastic container, not the bag.

Lastly, her water bowl is on the far side of the bed, also at the base of a lamp.  It should be emptied in the bathroom sink and refilled.

## Yog-soggoth

The hallway closet is the domain of Yog-soggoth and he is fed from neither bag nor container, but your very soul.  Thankfully, he only requires a couple every millenium, and was fed as recently as the 1600s.  He can be left to his own devices, and as I have recently installed an automatic laser pointer machine (as it turns out, also good for distracting pesky ancient gods), he shouldn't need entertainment either.
