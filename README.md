Instructions on how to feed my cats when I am away.

## Location of Cat Food

While facing the sink, open the floor cupboard furthest to the left.  This is where all the cat food and such lives.

## Rory

This cat inhabits the main area of the apartment, and is a complete pigs and lives to consume food.  Just fill his food bowls, he'll deplete them at his own pace.

His water dishes are located across the room from his food bowls, at the base of the tall black lamp.  Rory is a disgusting drinker, and uses his filthy, filthy paw to drink, which means his water will be gross when you get in.  Please empty and rinse his bowls before refilling.

There is more than one of each bowl, so please fill all, especially if you are going to leave for a few days.  In fact, before you leave for the final time, please make sure Rory has 3 bowls of water.  The extra bowl will be left out next to the sink.

## Midnight

Midnight fights with Rory (or Rory fights with Midnight, we don't know which) and thus is kept separate from him in the main bedroom.  She may not be visible when you enter, as she can be skittish.  Or she may be desperate for affection.  Who can know in advance?  She is a cat, and her whims are subject to no human scrutiny.

Her food bowl should be visible on entering the room, immediately opposite the door.  It will likely still be mostly full when you arrive, but if you feel like attempting to gain her (incredibly fickle) affection, you can add more food to the bowl and then supplicate before her.  She is fed from the plastic container as well.

Her water bowls are on the far side of the bed, also at the base of a lamp.  It should be emptied in the bathroom sink and refilled.

## Yog-soggoth

The hallway closet is the domain of Yog-soggoth and he is fed not from the container, but your very soul.  Thankfully, he only requires a couple every millenium, and was fed as recently as the 1600s.  He can be left to his own devices, and as I have recently installed an automatic laser pointer machine (as it turns out, also good for distracting pesky ancient gods), he shouldn't need entertainment either.

For all our safety, when you leave for a few days, please replace the battery in the automatic laser pointer machine.  If it runs out while you're away, there will be no gods powerful enough to rescue us from our eternal torment.
